### Summary
Your objective is to provide, as a proof of concept, database support to an application or related
applications, where multiple diverse database models are built and implemented for different purposes.
* Choose an enterprise, or an application that operates with large amount of data of various origin
  and different implementation. It can be any business of your choice where databases have a central
  role.
* Define functional and non-functional requirements to your project. Avoid limiting the project to
  performing maintenance operations only.
* Plan and motivate your decision on appropriate database types that could support the operability
  of the application. Consider using minimum three different database types from those introduced
  in class. As the databases operate in the same business domain, transformation and transition of
  data between the various database models is encouraged.
* Design and create the databases, populated with large amount of real or synthetic data that
  is sufficient to illustrate the database transactions management in a meaningful way. Consider
  validation and testing of your design and development process.
* Deploy the databases on localhost or other servers of choice, from where they can be accessed by
  the demo applications. Consider deploying one or more of the databases in a cluster, as
  appropriate to ensure performance optimization, ACID and CAP qualities.
* Create one or more simple related applications and implementation cases to demonstrate
  communication of clients and administrators with the specified database services and operations.
  No fancy graphical interfaces are expected. Alternatively, developer-supporting tools, such as
  database administration and maintenance dashboards, Postman, curl, or online platforms can be
  used. Keep in mind the data integration, though.
* Write an up-to-seven pages report, documenting your considerations on the development process
  and created product, covering all stages and components. Consider including installation
  instructions, if necessary.
